Narrative,Overshot the runway at Laoag Airport and came to rest partly submerged into the sea. (where it remained for some time).,Ground-looped after a heavy landing.01-08-1989,"The crash occurred shortly before as the plane was preparing to land at Patuxent River Naval Air Station. The crew had been conducting tests of tracking equipment during the short flight from Davison Army Air Field at Fort Belvoir. The plane crashed sank into the water about 50 yards off shore from the Naval Air Station, in 45 feet deep water.Reportedly, this aircraft crashed because the flight crew inadvertently selected ""beta range"" on the propellers at 800 feet. The aircraft then stalled and crashed into the river. The CASA aircraft was owned by the US Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) and carried both a military (88-0320) as well as civilian (N296CA) registration marks.","The Antonov 2 was overflying the Labor Day demonstration at Sechenovo. It was supposed to drop leaflets and descended to a very low altitude. A strong gust of wind blew the An-2 into a tree. The pilot lost control and the airplane crashed on a square, destroying a kiosk.","The no. 2 engine failed and the crew elected to divert to Mariehamn. Approaching Mariehamn at 2000 feet, the remaining engine quit. The Skyvan was ditched just offshore. PROBABLE CAUSE: Fuel starvation.",Ditched.02-12-1989,"Crashed into water after striking 40 feet high mangrove trees during a mosquito spray operation.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of the pilot-in-command to assure proper altitude and clearance was maintained above the terrain and trees. The trees and light condition at dusk were contributing factors.""02-05-1989",Landed on a wet runway and overran. The nosegear collapsed.,"Descended below MDA on a nighttime runway 06 NDB approach. The Citation hit trees and crashed 2,5 miles SW of the runway threshold. The elevation of the crash site was 600 feet msl, at a point where the MDA was 1160 feet msl.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Impairment of the pilot-in-command due to drugs/medication, chemotherapy and fatigue; failure of the pic to assure that the IFR (instrument) approach procedure was followed; and his failure to maintain the minimum descent altitude (MDA). Inadequate surveillance of the operation by company/operator/management personnel was a related factor.""","During arrival at Sedona, the pilot contacted Sedona UNICOM and was advised that runway 21 was in use and that the winds were gusting to 25 kts. He reported that turbulence was strong through-out the traffic pattern. Full flaps were lowered on final approach. A strong downdraft was encountered on final approach and power was increased 'to maintain VASI and Vref.' Turbulence and a downdraft were reported to be exceptionally strong over the threshold. The pilot stated the aircraft touched down on all 3 gear, then it pitched up and began to porpoise with increasing amplitude. On the second touchdown, power was applied, but the engine needed 5 to 7 sec to spool up. The pilot said that after the aircraft porpoise 3 times, it was in a stall from which it would not recover. Subsequently, it went off the right side of the runway, crossed a parallel taxiway and entered a wooded area before stopping.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Improper in-flight planning/decision by the pilot which resulted in his inability to flare the aircraft and/or recover from a bounced landing. Contributing factors were: crosswind, gusts, turbulence, downdraft, and the pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions.""02-10-1989","The An-2 was en route over the Yamal Peninsula when the engine failed. A forced landing was carried out in the tundra near Yar-Sale, causing damage to the landing gear, propeller and the lower wings.","The aircraft suffered a hydraulics failure while en route to Frunze (now Bishkek). The landing gear could not be lowered, forcing the crew to carry out a wheels-up landing on the grass at Frunze. The aircraft suffered substantial damage but all 3 crew and 40 passengers escaped unhurt.",Landed in stormy weather and suffered a gear collapse. The 737 slid off the runway and the no. 2 engine separated.03-04-1989,"Flying VFR in IFR conditions, the aircraft approached Samos. Having deviated 4nm from the H-59 airway, the aircraft was manoeuvred on a collision course with some mountains while turning for a runway 09 approach. The plane, named ""Isle of Milos"", struck cloud-shrouded Mount Kerkis (1430 m high).03-08-198903-08-198903-08-198903-08-198903-08-198903-08-198903-08-198903-08-1989",Damaged beyond repair in a heavy landing.,"While taxiing after a normal landing, a rumbling noise was heard from the vicinity of the nosegear, the hydraulic low pressure light illuminated and nosegear steering authority was lost. The right hand nosewheel had separated from the aircraft due to fracturing of the axle. As the nosewheel departed it damaged the nosegear uplock assembly with consequent loss of hydraulic system integrity. It then continued under the fuselage causing skin damage. The nosewheel axle was recovered and subjected to metallurgical examination which showed that the fracture was due to fatigue. The fracture resulted from prior long term fatigue cracking which occupied approximately 75 of the cross sectional area of the axle. Stress corrosion cracks were present which were the most likely initiator of the fatigue cracks. A mandatory crack inspection requirement called up for this axle did not cover the specific area in which the stress corrosion was located. Consequently, during the axle refurbishment, the stress corrosion cracks were covered by a layer of electroplated chromium.Significant Factors:1. The nosewheel axle failed due to fatigue initiated by stress corrosion cracks.2. The recurrent Non Destructive Inspection for the axles does not address the area where the stress corrosion occured. Consequently, pre- and post- refurbishment inspections did not detect the cracks.","A Varig Boeing 737-200, PP-VMK, was damaged beyond repair in a forced landing in the Amazon jungle in Brazil. Flight RG254 was a regular domestic service from São Paulo to Belém with an en route stop at Marabá. When the aircraft was preparing for departure at Marabá, the captain inadvertently entered the wrong course, 270 degrees in his Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI). The flight plan called for a course of 027 degrees.When the copilot returned from the walk-around check, he checked the course on the captain's HSI and inserted the same course in his HSI.The flight took off from Marabá at 17:25. The aircraft climbed to FL290 and maintained the 270 radial of Marabá for about forty minutes. The flight was then cleared to descend to FL200 by Belém ACC. However, the crew failed to find navigational aids and lost radio contact.Course was changed to 090 degrees as the aircraft further descended down to FL40. The crew then followed a river, heading 165 degrees. Because of the sunset and haze the pilot's had difficulty navigating. Also, they failed to establish radio contact on several frequencies and failed to find navaids in the area. Just after finding two NDB beacons the engines lost power due to fuel shortage. The aircraft lost altitude and the pilots were forced to carry out a landing in the dark and without external references. At about 20:45 the aircraft made a forced landing in the jungle. The aircraft was located 44 hours after the accident. Forty-one occupants survived and thirteen had sustained fatal injuries in the accident.It appeared that the computerized flight plan used a four digit representation of the magnetic bearing with the last digit being a tenth of a degree without any decimal separator. A course of '027.0' was presented as '0270'.03-09-1989","Cubana flight 9046 was destroyed in a takeoff accident at Havana-José Martí International Airport (HAV), Cuba. The aircraft, an Ilyuhsin 62M, operated on a charter flight from Havana to Milan, Italy, with a planned technical stop at Köln/Bonn, Germany.The aircraft was cleared for a departure from runway 05. Weather was poor with a rain storm over the field with a 7/8 cloud cover at 540-600 meters altitude and cumulonimbus clouds in the area. The final wind check before takeoff was reported to be 90 degrees at 20-26 knots. Takeoff was commenced at 18:56 hours. The gear was raised after takeoff and the flaps were selected up to 15° from 30° while the aircraft climbed through an altitude of 40 meters (130 ft), reaching a highest altitude of 56 meters (184 ft). The aircraft was caught in downdrafts and descended until impacting ILS aerials 67 seconds after commencing takeoff and 220 meters past the runway end. The aircraft broke up and burst into flames as it proceeded up a hill before crashing into a residential area. All 126 on board died in the accident, along with 24 persons on the ground. One passenger, a 22 year old male initially survived the crash but died on September 11, eight days after the accident.Probable cause (translated from Spanish):1) The existence of an adverse atmospheric phenomenon of windshear at low altitude, of which existence the captain did not know.2) An unwise decision of the pilot in command to not postpone the takeoff given the existing weather conditions near the airfield.03-09-1989",Destroyed by grenade on ground.,"Because of deteriorating weather conditions, the crew diverted to Augusta.

The wreckage was found one week later on a mountain side.07-08-1989,"Surinam Airways (SLM) carried out regular flights between Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport (AMS) and Paramaribo (PBM) using DC-8-60 planes. One of these a US-registered plane, N1809E, named ""Anthony Nesty"". The air crew was furnished by Air Crew International (ACI). The contract between Surinam Airways and ACI stipulated that ACI would furnish SLM with qualified crew members who held FAA certificates and who met the regulatory requirements to fly the DC-8. ACI did not provide for proficiency checks but left it to the individual pilots to meet the training and other requirements of their profession. One of the captains provided by ACI was involved in several incidents while operating on SLM flights. After investigation, SLM instructed ACI not to use this captain in future SLM assignments. However, he still acted as a crew member of several flights since. The captain was again scheduled on the accident flight PY764. According to regulations, the captain was not even qualified to act as pilot-in-command of that flight because of his age. He was 66 years old and Surinam regulations stipulated that ""the holder of a pilot certificate is not authorized to act as pilot during commercial flights when he/she has reached age 60"". Also, his most recent proficiency check flight was on a GA-7 Cougar twin instead of a DC-8.Flight PY764 departed Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport at 23:25 (June 6) on a flight to Paramaribo (PBM). The en route part of the flight was uneventful and about 20 minutes before arrival in Paramaribo the crew received the 07:00 UTC weather for Zanderij Airport: Wind calm, visibility 900 m in fog, temperature/dewpoint 22°C/22°C. This caught the crew by surprise since the previous weather information had included a visibility of 6 km. Because the ILS was not to be used for operational purposes, the copilot said: ""We don't legally have an ILS ... we have to use it"". The captain responded affirmatively. The crew were confident that they could land because they assumed that the fog was localized given the fact that they were able to see the airport during the descent.Zanderij Tower then cleared the flight for a VOR/DME approach to runway 10. The captain tuned in to the ILS and instructed the first officer to set the final approach course for the published VOR/DME approach on the first officer's side.During the approach the first officer reported that he could see the airport:""Runway's at twelve o'clock"". A minute later he commented ""A little bit of low fog comin' up I reckon just a little bit"". He was still able to see the runway and reported the runway in sight. The DC-8 then entered some stratus clouds the captain told the first officer to ""Tell him [tower controller] to turn the runway lights up ... Tell him to put the runway lights bright"". The captain attempted to capture the unreliable ILS glide slope signal, but failed to capture it.The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded several times: ""Glideslope ... glideslope..."" until it was deactivated. The captain was flying the aircraft below the minimum altitude for the ILS/DME approach procedure (260 ft asl) as well as below the minimum descent altitude for the VOR/DME approach procedure (560 ft). The first officer called out: ""Two hundred feet"". Thirteen seconds later the no. 2 engine contacted a tree. The right wing then struck another tree, causing the aircraft to roll, striking the ground inverted. The airplane broke up and a fire erupted.CAUSE: ""The Commission determines: a) That as a result of the captain's glaring carelessness and recklessness the aircraft was flown below the published minimum altitudes during the approach and consequently collided with a tree. b) As underlying factor in the accident was the failure of SLM's operational management to observe the pertinent regulations as well as the procedures prescribed in the SLM Operations Manual concerning qualification and certification during recruitment and employment of the crew members furnished by ACI.""07-06-198907-06-198907-06-198907-06-1989","Okada Air Flight OKJ 307 originated from Lagos (LOS), at about 17:10 hours UTC en-route to Port-Harcourt (PHC).By 17:40 hours, at FL250, the crew established contact with Port Harcourt Tower and was cleared to the ""PR"" Radio Beacon. The 1700 hours weather report was passed onto the crew with the assurance not to expect any delay for an ILS approach to runway 21.At 75 nm from Port Harcourt, the aircraft was cleared down to FL90 and the crew reviewed their approach briefings. The First Officer was still flying when the airplane was further cleared to 2000 feet with the instructions to report when established on the localizer.At 700 feet, the Commander had the field-in-sight but the flying pilot had not. Then the Commander took over control from the First Officer. The captain requested the tower to increase approach lights intensity because of drizzling rain. The BAC 1-11 passed an area of heavy downpour. It entered a high sink rate and made a hard landing. The airplane bounced and made the second touchdown on its nose-wheel. The right nose wheel shattered instantaneously while the second nose wheel fractured at the hub. It rolled for about 90 metres and crumbled under the weight of the aircraft. When both wheels of the nose gear had broken away, the wheel axle made contact with runway to cut grooves onto the runway surface for about 25 metres before the nose strut finally gave way. The aircraft now scooped forward on the nose fuselage section and continued off the runway on to the left shoulder. On the shoulder, the aircraft ran into the wide trench which was covered up with loose soil and the impact severed off the right main gear from the attachment point. The aircraft eventually came to a stop 735 meters after touchdown.CAUSE OF ACCIDENT: ""The probable cause of this accident is the poor handling of the controls at the critical movement of final approach and landing phases, probably due to the sudden loss of azimuth in the heavy down pour of rain. The contributory factor to the accident is the excavation and improper refilling of the outrageous trenches of wide dimensions along the length of runway 03/21.""07-09-1989","Force landed and burned out following double engine fire, possibly as a result of small arms fire.The aircraft carried jet fuel for the Angolan Air Force.08-04-1989","Islander ZK-EVK departed from Wanaka on a VFR scenic flight to Milford Sound but failed to arrive. Wreckage from the aircraft was subsequently located on steep snow covered mountainous terrain at elevations up to 5400 feet. Following initial impact, major portions of the aircraft, including the fuselage, had fallen over precipitous bluffs.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The lack of direct evidence to account, operationally or structurally, for the manner in which the aircraft struck the mountain slope, the remoteness of the site which provided no witness observation to describe the aircrafts flight path prior to the event and the absence of any survivor, combined to preclude a determination of the accidents probable cause.""","The ELINT aircraft operated on a flight from Cam Ranh to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. On landing in below minima weather conditions the aircraft deviated from the glide path and touched the ground 114 metres before the runway threshold, ripping off the right main gear and damaging the right outer wing, propeller no.4 and both hydraulics systems. The crew discontinued the landing and decided to return to Cam Ranh. On landing at Cam Ranh the crew feathered engine no. 1.

The departure was delayed by almost an hour due to the CAA Norway and the catering company having suspended Partnair´s credit. Once the financial problem was settled the crew was given permission to depart.During the period September 6-8, 1989 LN-PAA experienced some technical problems with the left AC power system. The AC generator was replaced, but the malfunction in the system remained. On the flight to Hamburg it was decided to use the APU generator as the electrical power source for the left AC system.LN-PAA took off at 15:59:50. The flight proceeded normally to the planned cruise level, which was FL220. At 16:04 Flight 394 was cleared direct to AAL VOR/DME (Aalborg). When the aircraft climbed through FL180 at 16:16, the crew was informed by Oslo ACC about strong westerly winds at altitude. The air traffic controller suggested a 101 heading change to the right. At 16:22 Flight 394 was informed that the radar service from Oslo ACC terminated and that the flight would enter Danish-controlled air space in 2 minutes. The flight was then requested to contact Copenhagen ACC. The airplane reached its cruising level at 16:23. Half a minute later the crew established contact with Copenhagen ACC and informed them that PAR 394 was maintaining FL220, whereupon Copenhagen ACC confirmed that they had radar contact. This was the last radio contact with the flight. The flight proceeded normally until about 16:38.Vibrations occurred in the vertical stabilizer. These vibrations developed into violent oscillations or flutter of the horizontal tail surfaces and rudder. Vital parts of the tail section then failed and the crew lost control of the airplane. Both wings failed simultaneously under negative G loads. The Convair fell into the sea.CAUSES: ""The accident was caused by loss of control due to the destruction  of primary control surfaces in the tail section, which, in turn, was caused by aeroelastic oscillations initiated by abnormal clearances in the vertical stabiliser attachments to the fuselage structure.The condition of the attachments was a result of excessive wear in pins and sleeves used in this structural joint. The pins and sleeves were of an inferior quality and did not satisfy specified values for hardness and tensile strength. They had also been installed and inspected using sub-standard maintenance procedures. Undamped oscillations in the elevator contributed to the structural failure of the empennage.""08-09-198908-09-198908-09-1989",Crashed while dropping an M551 Sheridan tank over the Sicily Drop Zone at Fort Bragg.09-08-1989,Destroyed by terrorist bomb.,Crashed on beach following engine failure.,"The aircraft was routinely flown to Pensacola, FL to pickup a Gulf Power executive for a flight to Atlanta, GA.

After takeoff the CVR recorded the passenger stating that there was a fire. The fire in the aft cabin area was confirmed by the 1st officer. An emergency was declared to the Pensacola ATCT. Subsequently, the aircraft was seen descending out of the overcast streaming dark smoke behind it. The aircraft impacted an apartment complex and a post crash fire destroyed it. No evidence of a lightning strike, aircraft system malfunction, or incendiary device was found during the investigation. Forensic chemical tests showed traces of hydrochloric and sulphuric acid on passengers articles but none on the cabin interior. Metallurgical examination of a broken fuel line showed overload failure and post heat distress. The interior of the cockpit windows were severely sooted.

The aircraft proceeded to Valence at FL130. At 20:43 the flight passed the Lespi intersection and continued on a 133deg heading to the VNE VOR. At 20:49 the aircraft was cleared to descend to FL70 and FL60 when approaching VNE VOR. At 20:56 the FH-227 passed the VNE VOR and was to head 178deg for Valence. The aircraft however continued on a 155deg heading. The heading was changed to 178deg at 21:04. At 21:07 the aircraft struck a mountain (Col de Tourniol) at 1260 m.PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from original French language report): ""The accident is the direct result of a navigational error. This error had the direct causes: 1) the display and use the VOR LSA instead of VNE;2) an insufficiency in the mental representation of the path of the aircraft despite other available information.Moreover, the lack of rigor in the division of work in their execution and in the mutual control are contributing factors.The Committee also noted that the following facts have facilitated the development of a critical situation:1) documentation of the crew used for navigation and organization of the dashboard of the plane could be sources of error, 2) the organization of the airspace in the region of Valence did not allow optimal use of existing radar;3) the tasks of the crew were not defined by the operator; 4) the co-pilot had a moderate but significant blood alcohol level.""10-04-1989","The Il-76 transport plane was flying a training mission when it crashed while on approach to Novgorod-Krechevitsy Airport, Russia.

The no. 1 and 2 engines were relit while descending through FL130 and the remaining 2 engines were relit at FL110. The aircraft landed safely at Anchorage, substantially damaged by the in-flight blasting by volcanic ash. The windshields were damaged, as were internal aircraft systems, avionics and electronics.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Inadvertent encounter with volcanic ash cloud, which resulted in damage from foreign material (foreign object) and subsequent compressor stalling of all engines.  A factor related to the accident was:  the lack of available information about the ash cloud to all personnel involved.""15-12-1989",Crashed.,Crashed shortly after takeoff.15-05-1989,Ditched 100 m offshore.15-11-198915-11-1989,"Twin Otter ""Engano"" crashed on approach to Bintuni (NTI).","The Yak-40 passenger jet deviated from approach the pattern and glide path and touched down at excessive speed, bouncing three times. The airplane veered off the runway and suffered substantial structural damage.","During arrival, the flight was issued the current altimeter setting. The pilot requested vectors for an approach to runway 18, but the ARTCC controller could not accommodate the request. The pilot was cleared for a VOR/DME-A approach. MDA for the approach was 1080 feet msl (600 feet agl). FBO personnel observed the aircraft fly over the airport and advised that it was too low. One of the pilots replied that they would be 'staying under the clouds.' The pilots had planned to land on runway 36, but reported they lost sight of the runway and would change to runway 18. Subsequently, the aircraft collided with a tree about 1 mile NNE of the airport, while on a westerly heading (approx position of base leg for a VFR pattern). The aircraft came to rest about 700 feet west of the tree and was destroyed by impact and fire. The weather was in part: scattered clouds at 200 feet, overcast at 900 feet, visibility 3 miles with rain and fog, wind from 360 deg at 7 kts. The airport manager estimated there was a 200 feet ceiling at the airport.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Failure of the pilot to follow IFR procedures and maintain the minimum descent altitude (MDA). Factors related to the accident were: darkness, the adverse weather conditions, and the tree.""","The left wheel ran off the side of the snow-covered runway. The pilot corrected the situation, but didn't get airborne in time.

The airplane was on base leg when the left engine sputtered. The pilot turned on the secondary boost pump and the engine operated normally until both engines flamed out. During the forced landing in a residential area, the airplane hit a power line, trees, a house, a fireplug, a tree and a van, then another house. There was no smell of fuel in the entire area, and no usable fuel in the fuel system.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The inadequate preflight planning preparation and the improper inflight planning/decision by the pic when he failed to refuel the aircraft which resulted in a total loss of power in both engines.""","A jammed rudder and elevator caused the pilot to abort the takeoff at lift-off.

The aircraft was on a flight from Cape Schmidt.,"United Flight 232 departed Denver at 14:09 CDT for a flight to Philadelphia. Cruising altitude was FL370. About 1 hour and 7 minutes after takeoff the crew heard a loud bang, followed by vibration and a shuddering of the airframe; the no. 2 engine had suffered an uncontained failure. It then appeared that the hydraulic pressure was zero. The DC-10 didn't respond anymore to flight control inputs and the descending right turn was arrested by using no. 1 engine power reduction. The air driven generator (ADG), which powers the no. 1 auxiliary hydraulic pump, was deployed but hydraulic power couldn't be restored. An emergency was declared at 15:20, and vectors to Sioux City were given by Minneapolis ARTCC. An off-duty training check airman was travelling on Flight 232 and offered his assistance. He was asked to manipulate the throttles to control pitch and roll, which was difficult because the plane had a continuous tendency to turn to the right The no. 1 and 3 thrust levers couldn't be used symmetrically, so he used two hands to manipulate the throttles. Sioux City Airport was sighted at 9 miles out, but the aircraft was aligned with the closed runway 22 (6600 feet long) instead of the longer (8999 feet) runway 31. Given the position and the difficulty in making left turns, the approach to runway 22 was continued. The aircraft approached with a high sink rate (1620 feet/min for the last 20 seconds) at an airspeed of 215 knots. At about 100 feet above the ground the nose began to pitch downward and the right wing dropped. The plane touched down on the threshold slightly left of the centreline, skidded to the right and rolled inverted. The DC-10 caught fire and cartwheeled.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility which resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls.""19-07-1989",A Moroccan man hijacked a Royal Air Maroc ATR-42. The aircraft was carrying 8 passengers and crew. The hijacker was armed with a toy pistol and a toy hand grenade. He threatened to blow up the plane if his demands were not met.The hijacker surrendered to authorities after negotiations.,"The DC-10 was operating as UTA Flight 772 on the Brazzaville-N'Djamena-Paris route. The aircraft took off from N'Djamena at 13:13 and climbed to a cruising altitude of FL350. At 13:59 an explosion on board caused the aircraft to crash into the desert. The explosive device was located at location 13R in the cargo hold. The device was most probably hidden in baggage, placed aboard at Brazzaville. Possible groups responsible for the explosion are the Islamic Jihad group (demanding the freedom of a Shi'ite Muslim in Israel) or the Secret Chadian Resistance. Co-incidental on March 10, 1984 another UTA aircraft was destroyed when a bomb exploded; in this case the bomb exploded during embarkation at N'Djamena.CONCLUSIONS: ""-  DC-10 flight UTA 772, Brazzaville N'Djamena - Paris, was destroyed by an explosion on 19 September 1989, forty-six minutes after take-off from N'Djamena, while cruising at flight level 350 in totally normal conditions. - That destruction was due to an explosive charge placed in a container in location 13-R in the forward cargo hold.- The Investigation Commission assert that the most plausible hypothesis is that the explosive charge was inside baggage loaded at Brazzaville Airport.- Observations made shortly after the accident on Brazzaville Airport made it clear that, at that time, the airport security measures in force were not in accordance with the ICAO standards and recommended practices (Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation and Civil Aviation SecurityManual (DOC 8973)).""19-09-198919-09-1989",The captain instructed the copilot to take over control of the aircraft while they were on finals. The copilot did not comply and the An-2 continued the approach.

The aircraft carried a cargo of 37200 kg. Approaching Leninakan the flight was cleared to descend to 3300 metres. During the descent the approach controller reported the airport pressure being 637 mm Hg. After issuing a further clearance down to 1100 metres, the controller corrected the airport pressure to 637 mm Hg. Erroneously the crew programmed their barometric altimeters using 736 instead of 636 mm Hg, causing a difference in altitude indication of about 1100 metres. Descent was continued at a vertical speed of 10 m/sec. At a height of 270 metres the GPWS alarm began to sound and continued to 19 seconds. Then the flight engineer suddenly informed the captain of the mistake, but no corrective action was taken. Ten seconds later the aircraft struck terrain and crashed.PROBABLE CAUSE: - error by the crew in programming both barometric altimeters using the 736 mm Hg pressure instead of the actual 636 mm Hg causing a descent below MDA;- failure to use the radio altimeters, which deprived the crew of additional information about their descent below MDA; - failure of the crew to respond to the recommendation by the flight engineer to climb;Factors were:- the fact that it was the instructor captain's first flight into Leninakan and the student pilot's (in the right hand seat) first flight on an Il-76;- insufficient crew resource management;- insufficient training of pilots regarding the actions to be taken in case of a GPWS warning",The Islander had departed Adana (ADA) for a photo mapping flight of a forested area near the border with Syria. Some 20 km from the Syrian border the airplane was shot down by two Syrian Air Force MiG-21bis fighter jets.,"USAir flight 1846 was scheduled to departure from Baltimore/Washington (BWI) at 15:10, but air traffic inbound to New York-LaGuardia (LGA) delayed the takeoff until 19:35. Holding on the taxiway at BWI for 1.5 hours required the flight to return to the terminal area for fuel. The Boeing 737-400 left BWI uneventfully and arrived at LGA's Gate 15 at 20:40.Weather and air traffic in the LGA terminal area had caused cancellations and delayed most flights for several hours. The USAir dispatcher decided to cancel the Norfolk leg of Flight 1846, unload the passengers, and send the flight to Charlotte (CLT) without passengers. Several minutes later, the dispatcher told the captain that his airplane would not be flown empty but would carry passengers to Charlotte as USAir flight 5050. This seemed to upset the captain. He expressed concern for the passengers because more delays would cause him and the first officer to exceed crew duty time limitations before the end of the trip. While passengers were boarding, the captain visited USAir's ground movement control tower to ask about how decisions were made about flights and passengers.The captain returned to the cockpit as the last of the passengers were boarding, and the entry door was closed. After the jetway was retracted, the passenger service representative told the captain through the open cockpit window that he wanted to open the door again to board more passengers. The captain refused, and flight 5050 left Gate 15 at 22:52.The 737 taxied out to runway 31. Two minutes after push-back, the ground controller told the crew to hold short of taxiway Golf Golf. However, the captain failed to hold short of that taxiway and received modified taxi instructions from the ground controller at 22:56. The captain then briefed takeoff speeds as V1: 125 knots, VR: 128 knots, and V2: 139 knots. The first officer was to be the flying pilot. About 2 minutes later, the first officer announced ""stabilizer and trim"" as part of the before-takeoff checklist. The captain responded with ""set"" and then corrected himself by saying: ""Stabilizer trim, I forgot the answer. Set for takeoff."" Flight 5050 was cleared into position to hold at the end of the runway at 23:18:26 and received takeoff clearance at 23:20:05. The first officer pressed the autothrottle disengage and then pressed the TO/GA button, but noted no throttle movement. He then advanced the throttles manually to a ""rough"" takeoff-power setting. The captain then said: ""Okay, that's the wrong button pushed"" and 9 seconds later said: ""All right, I'll set your power."" During the takeoff roll the airplane began tracking to the left. About 18 seconds after beginning the roll a ""bang"" was heard followed shortly by a loud rumble. At 23:20:53, the captain said ""got the steering."" The captain later testified that he had said, ""You've got the steering."" The first officer testified that he thought the captain had said: ""I've got the steering."" When the first officer heard the captain, he said ""Watch it then"" and began releasing force on the right rudder pedal but kept his hands on the yoke in anticipation of the V1 and rotation callouts.At 23:20:58.1, the captain said: ""Let's take it back then"" which he later testified meant that he was aborting the takeoff. According to the captain, he rejected the takeoff because of the continuing left drift and the rumbling noise. He used differential braking and nose wheel steering to return toward the centerline and stop. The throttle levers were brought back to their idle stops at 23:20:58.4. The indicated airspeed at that time was 130 knots. Increasing engine sound indicating employment of reverse thrust was heard on the CVR almost 9 seconds after the abort maneuver began. The airplane did not stop on the runway but crossed the end of the runway at 34 knots ground speed. The aircraft dropped onto the wooden approach light pier, which collapsed causing the aircraft break in three and drop into 7-12 m deep East River.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's failure to exercise his command authority in a timely manner to reject the take-off or take sufficient control to continue the take-off, which was initiated with a mistrimmed rudder. Also causal was the captain's failure to detect the mistrimmed rudder before the take-off was attempted.""Board member Jim Burnett filed the following concurring and dissenting statement: ""Although I concur with the probable cause as adopted as far as it goes, I would have added the following as a contributing factor: Contributing to the cause of the accident was the failure of USAir to provide an adequately experienced and seasoned flight crew.""20-09-198920-09-198920-09-1989","While shutting down the engines, an explosion occurred due to an overheated fuel pump.20-09-1989","The Lockheed L-188PF Electra aircraft carried out a training flight at the Almirante Zar Naval Air Station at Trelew, Argentina.While performing a touch-and-go, the aircraft contacted a truck that was parked at the side of the runway.

The departure was delayed because of poor weather at Sovetsky.The weather gradually improved and the aircraft then departed Perm at 13:55 Moscow time. After an uneventful flight, the aircraft positioned for an approach to runway 30. The approach was conducted in darkness and poor visibility conditions. The weather reported to the crew on final approach (80 m overcast, 2000 m visibility) was below minima for the An-24.Nevertheless, the flight crew continued the approach. By then the aircraft had already descended below the glideslope.The radio altimeter warned the crew when the descent was continued below a height of 62 m, but the aircraft kept descending.At a height of 35 meters the flight crew attempted to pull up, but the aircraft collided with trees at a distance of 180 m to the right of the extended runway centreline. The no.2 engine autofeathered as a result, but the no.1 engine was delivering go around power. This caused the aircraft to enter a 27° right hand bank. This was briefly countered by the crew before the aircraft again rolled hard right and subsequently impacted terrain 700 m from the threshold, 250 m right of the extended centreline.","TAN-SAHSA flight 414, a Boeing 727-200 was a scheduled flight from San José (SJO), Costa Rica to Tegucigalpa (TGU), Honduras with an intermediate stop at Managua (MGA), Nicaragua.At the end of the final leg of the flight, the crew were cleared by Tegucigalpa ATC for the VOR/DME runway 01 approach, which includes a series of three step-downs from the initial approach fix altitude of 7500 ft MSL to avoid high terrain in the neighborhood of the airport. Rather than following the prescribed step-down procedure, however, the crew began a continuous descent from about 7600 ft MSL at about 11 NM from the airport to the accident site. The aircrafts descent profile was well below the published step-down course for the entire approach. The aircraft impacted a mountain known as Cerro de Hula at the 4800 ft MSL elevation, approximately 800 ft below the summit, 4.8 NM from the Tegucigalpa runway 01 threshold.

No further calls were received from the aircraft. The Cockatoo Island work boat was 56 kilometres north-north-west of Derby, and approximately 20 kilometres west of the direct track between Cockatoo Island and Derby. The crew of the boat observed an aircraft approaching at very low level. The aircraft passed over the boat approximately 5-7 metres above the deck, and entered a right hand turn. During the turn the right wing tip struck the water causing the aircraft to cartwheel and crash about 400 metres from the boat. The fuselage broke open on impact and the occupants were subsequently rescued by the crew of the boat. The pilot declined to provide any information which might have clarified the circumstances of the accident, however, available information indicates that he carried out an unauthorized low pass over the boat. During the turn following the low pass, he misjudged the aircraft's height and the right wing tip struck the water.Significant Factors:1. The pilot was neither trained nor authorized to conduct operations at low level.2. The pilot exercised poor judgement by operating at an unnecessarily low height.3. The pilot misjudged his height above the water.","The DC-3 entered a spin after completing a turn at 2200 feet agl, recovered, entered a second spin and crashed.

Factors related to the accident were: use of excessive elevator trim, the pic's lack of training (in approaches to stalls) and lack of experience in the make/model of aircraft, and the co-pilot's lack of recent experience in the make/model of aircraft.""22-05-1989",The C-54 suffered a nose gear collapse on landing. The airplane sustained damage to the nose and no. 2 and 3 propellers.,"The flight from Mount Isa, Australia, had been conducted in rain and cloud. At 5000 feet during the descent, the pilot became visual with the runway lights of Kidston Airport and the nearby goldmine. The runway was overflown, and it was noted that the windsock was showing no significant wind. During the circuit for landing on runway 21, increasing rain and cloud was noticed on downwind, and on left base the pilot experienced heavy rain and strong wind gusts. The pilot had turned the windscreen wipers on but they were not clearing the windscreen effectively. Forward visibility was significantly reduced, and on final approach the pilot was having difficulty keeping the aircraft aligned with the runway due to the turbulence and wind gusts. He elected to go around and carry out another circuit. During the next circuit the conditions had not improved, and the pilot again decided to go around, as it had become increasingly difficult to maintain runway alignment. As the go-around was commenced the pilot heard a loud bang and realised the aircraft had struck trees. The aircraft was climbed and the Kidston NDB approach procedure was carried out. The pilot became visual at 2900 feet and carried a circuit and landing on runway 03. (Kidston is 1620 feet above sea level). After shutdown the aircraft was inspected and was found to have sustained tree impact damage to the left inboard leading edge, the left propeller, and the left horizontal stabiliser. The pilot believes the tree strike occurred as a result of downdraft associated with the storms in the immediate area. The Kidston aerodrome is established according to the provisions of AIP AGA-6 and although approved for the night operation being conducted, it does not have an approach guidance lighting system. The aerodrome does not have any other ground lighting in the immediate vicinity other than the runway lights, and this may lead to the pilot having a false perception of height and runway perspective. It is considered that the lack of approach guidance, combined with the prevailing weather conditions, contributed significantly to the cause of this accident. There is rising terrain on the approaches to runway 21. The pilot reported that he was having difficulty with forward visibility due to the ineffectiveness of the windscreen wipers. The effect of heavy rain on aircraft windshields may lead to a number of visual errors. One effect is to make objects appear to be lower in relation to the aircraft than they actually are. Whilst it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of the error, the elements were present in this accident, and may have given the pilot a false impression of his height in relation to the runway lights.Significant Factors:1. Weather associated with thunderstorms in the local area.2. The aerodrome is not equipped with a runway approach lighting system.3. During a visual approach the pilot encountered excessive crosswind, reduced visibility and turbulence.4. The aircraft struck a tree on the approach to runway 21, due to the inability of the pilot to appreciate the proximity of the aircraft to the terrain on final approach.5. The aircraft windscreen wipers were not working efficiently.6. Excessive rain on the windscreen may have caused a visual error and contributed to the pilot flying the aircraft into an undershoot situation.",Gear retraction after boarding.

The aircraft took off from Pune at 19:28 hours. The flight was uneventful up to 19:43. Soon thereafter, the aircraft started loosing height rapidly with increasing speed. The pilot attempted recover the aircraft from the dive but the aircraft continued to lose height till it impacted the back waters Ujjaini Dam. The accident happened in night time conditions with isolated thunderstorms and localised heavy rain in the area.The cause of the accident has been attributed as:""Entry of the aircraft into severe turbulent conditions while passing through clouds, leading to rapid loss of height of the aircraft because of inappropriate action by the pilots. As a result, the aircraft entered a spiral. This was not recognised by the pilots, resulting in initiation of incorrect recovery action by pulling back on the control column instead of first levelling the wings. The possibility of jamming of the elevator of the aircraft cannot be ruled out as one of the probable cause of the accident.""Disorientation; unpreparedness of the pilots and their failure to recognise in time, a serious situation and take appropriate corrective action; long breaks in night flying in the case of the captain and temporary malfunction or sluggishness of ADI are the contributory causes.","A runway 01 instrument approach at Posadas was aborted because the Learjet came in too high.

The captain declined both offers.The aircraft took off again at 22.03 using runway 27. Since Pasco tower was closing at 22:30, Seattle Center cleared the flight for an ILS runway 21R approach. At 22:30 the aircraft was observed descending fast from a higher than normal altitude. The aircraft suddenly nosed over and crashed short of the runway.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's decision to continue an unstabilized instrument landing system approach that led to a stall, most likely of the horizontal stabilizer, and loss of control at low altitude. Contributing to the accident was the air traffic controller's improper vectors that positioned the airplane inside the outer marker while it was still well above the glide slope. Contributing to the stall and loss of control was the accumulation of airframe ice that degraded the aerodynamic performance of the airplane.""","A Douglas C-118A (DC-6A) fire fighting plane was destroyed in an accident near Sainte-Anne-des-Monts, QC, Canada. All four crew members were killed.The Conifair plane took off from Bonaventure Airport, QC (YVB) at 19:15 for a spray operation 30 miles southeast of Sainte-Anne-des-Monts. This was to be the last spraying flight of the season out of the Bonaventure base. A crew of four was on board, including two flight engineers who were on a familiarization training flight. The aircraft was carrying 2,952 U.S. gallons of Dipel 132, a non-toxic microbial insecticide.The aircraft arrived over the spray area at 19:35. An inertial navigation system (INS) to follow pre-established spraying tracks. The first track was sprayed uneventfully. At the end of the first track, the aircraft made a 180-degree turn to spray the second track, which was parallel to and about 800 feet northeast of the first track. This meant that the aircraft had to fly from a valley at an elevation of 1,000 feet above sea level (asl) up a mountain consisting of two levels. The first level is about 1,800 feet asl and about 3,280 feet along the flight path. After the first level, the terrain rose within approximately 1,000 feet along the flight path, to the summit of the mountain at an elevation of 2,175 feet asl.The two occupants of a Cessna 310 spotter aircraft observed a decrease of the DC-6A ground speed during the climb over the first level of the mountain. They then noticed that the aircraft yawed and started a steep, left turn. The spotter crew stated that, shortly after the start of the left turn, the DC-6A left wing began to strike trees. The aircraft nosed down, crashed on the side of the mountain, and exploded at an elevation of 2,050 feet asl.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""On a low-level spraying flight, the crew attempted a climb over rising terrain which exceeded the climb performance of the aircraft.""","Climbing through 200-300 feet after takeoff a portion of the right aileron fabric separated. Then the pilot's control wheel became free. Although the mechanic in the right seat told him that his controls were functioning normally, the pilot disagreed and he ditched the aircraft.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's improper decision to ditch the aircraft when it could have been flown back to the airport using the right seat controls. Contributing factor(s) was: the failure and separation of a portion of the right aileron fabric and the pilot's excessive force applied to the control wheel which resulted in overstressing the aileron control chain.26-06-1989",A Czechoslovakian male armed with a fake grenade hijacked a Czechoslovak YAK-40 commuter flight with 27 passengers during a flight between Prague and Karlovy Vary. The hijacker demanded thepilot fly to a Western European country. A security guard overpowered the hijacker and the aircraft landed without incident. The hijacker received 13 years imprisonment.,The aircraft crashed during a training flight.,"Flight CI204 collided with a mountain in the Chiashan mountain range at an elevation of 7000 feet, 3 minutes after takeoff.PROBABLE CAUSE: The crew used the climbout procedure of the wrong runway, causing the aircraft to make a left instead of right turn.26-10-1989",A gust of wind on touchdown caused the pilot to lose control. The Twin Otter struck a ditch and sustained irreparable damage.26-10-1989,"The Sabreliner ran off runway on landing, causing the undercarriage to collapse.",The An-26 military transport plane flew into the side of a 2310 m-high mountain at an altitude of 1500 m. The pilot descended VFR in instrument weather.The airplane operated for the Air Force Strategic Missile Forces.,"A Swearingen SA227-AC Metro III passenger plane, operating as Skylink Flight 070 was destroyed in accident at Terrace Airport, BC (YXT), Canada. All five passengers and two crew members were killed.Flight 070 took off from Vancouver, BC (YVR) at 06:51 on a scheduled domestic flight to Terrace, BC. At 08:20 Flight 070 was cleared for an approach at Terrace. At 08:27, at an altitude of 1,200 feet asl and just prior to reaching the published missed approach point (MAP), the captain stated ""OK, I got the button here."" Fourteen seconds after this, the captain saw the button of runway 27. At approximately this same time, the aircraft was observed on what corresponded to a downwind leg for runway 15 at about 500 feet above ground level (agl), flying straight and level over the threshold of runway 27, with the landing gear down. The aircraft crossed the localizer transmitter at an altitude of 1,100 feet asl and at an airspeed of 140 knots. Approximately 30 seconds after crossing the localizer transmitter, the aircraft commenced a descent out of 1,100 feet, and the flaps were lowered to the full position. The aircraft then levelled at an altitude of approximately 900 feet. At or about this same time, the aircraft was observed on base leg for runway 15 at a low altitude, close to the east/west ridge located about 1.5 miles north of the airport. Twenty-six seconds after full flap was selected, a missed approach was initiated, and the landing gear and flaps were selected up. Within five seconds of the initiation of the missed approach, the aircraft began to accelerate and a rate of climb of approximately 1,200 feet per minute was established. This rate of climb quickly diminished to zero, followed by the start of a descent which quickly increased to 3,000 feet per minute. As the aircraft descended, the co-pilot called ""descending"" twice. A few seconds later, the aircraft struck trees on the west side of runway 15 just inside the airport perimeter. A second and final impact with the ground occurred just outside the airport perimeter approximately 800 feet from the initial tree strike. A fire erupted following the ground impact.PROBABLE CAUSE:""The crew continued with the approach beyond the missed approach point without establishing the required visual references. The evidence indicates that, while subsequently carrying out a missed approach in IFR conditions, the aircraft was flown into the ground in a manner consistent with disorientation. Contributing to the occurrence were the inadequacy of the company's operating procedures, the reduced operating standards, and the inadequate definition of the visual references required for a circling approach.""26-09-1989","Flight 803 departed Seoul (SEL) on a flight to Tripoli (TIP) with intermediate stops at Bangkok (BKK) and Jeddah (JED). Weather was poor as the aircraft approached Tripoli. Visibility was varying between 100-800 feet and the runway 27 ILS had been reported unserviceable. On final approach to runway 27 the aircraft crashed short of the runway, striking 4 houses and a number of cars.27-07-1989","The aircraft ran off the strip during takeoff, cart wheeled and struck a building.","A Cuban immigrant, who came to the U.S. as part of the Mariel boatlift, hijacked an American Airlines Boeing 727 and demanded to be flown to Cuba. The flight was en route from Dallas to Miamiand was carrying 157 passengers and crew. The hijacker stated he was armed with a pistol and explosives. In actuality he had a starter pistol, two knives and a pair of scissors. After the aircraft landed in Miami to refuel, the hijacker surrendered.","Flight 203 departed Bogotá at 07:11 for a flight to Cali. While climbing through FL130, a bomb detonated on board, igniting fuel vapours in an empty fuel tank. The subsequent explosion caused the aircraft to crash. Some sources claim 3 people were killed on the ground.27-11-198919 MAY 1966N326PAPan Am15 NOV 1975HK-1803Avianca","The aircraft, flown by Tepper Aviations chief, reportedly was carrying out a flight on behalf of the CIA to provide the Angolan UNITA guerrilla forces with weapons. It crashed while coming in to land at Jamba. These flights were flown at night at a very low altitude to avoid MPLA radar detection. The runway at Jamba was dirt, the approach was over trees, and the portable runway lighting was probably marginally adequate.27-11-198927-11-1989",Crashed.,"The aircraft took off from Grand Canyon at around 09:00 for the second tour flight that day. After the tour, Canyon flight 5 was cleared for a runway 21 approach. The plane travelled down the runway about 5 feet in the air for about 1000 feet before it bounced on landing. The aircraft travelled 1000 feet and touched down on the right wingtip, crushing the aileron/flap hinge up into the wing. Full power was applied for a go-around. Control was lost as the aircraft attained an extreme nose-up attitude and the aircraft crashed into trees.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Improper pilot techniques and crew coordination during the landing attempt, bounce, and attempted go-around.""27-09-1989",Damaged beyond repair in forced landing.,"The An-24 crashed in Malioasa forest while on a flight to Belgrade to pick up humanitarian supplies.An investigation concluded that there was an external factor that caused the crew to lose control. The aircraft was likely fired at, possibly using a missile, at the end of the Romanian revolution.Probable cause (translated from Romanian): The probable cause which determined the crash of the AN-24 aircraft registered YR-BMJ in the day of 28th of December, 1989 near the Visina village, Dimbovita county is the action of a force outside the aircraft, including the possibility of the impact with a foreign object located outside of it and in its flight trajectory, in the area of the left horizontal stabilizer, which is appreciated to have weakened the structure of the left horizontal stabilizer, to have caused an uncommanded and sudden trim of the horizontal stabilizer and a jam in this position, causing the aircraft to enter a dive and the impossibility of the flight crew to actuate the flight controls [in such a manner] to regain control of the flight trajectory, due to reasons independent of the aircraft as well as the will and actions of the crew.",The Tupolev undershot the runway by 300 metres during a night landing. The airplane broke up and burned out.,The aircraft crashed 10 min after takeoff.28-06-1989,"The crew managed to land during the third landing attempt in stormy weather. Touchdown however, was 400 m short of the runway end.

The aircraft climbed to 1000 feet and descended to 500 feet at 18:30. The plane struck a 27deg rocky slope on the north-eastern slopes of the coastal mountains on the island of Molokai at around 600 feet.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The decision of the captain to continue flight under visual flight rules at night into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), which obscured rising mountainous terrain. Contributing to the accident was the inadequate supervision of personnel, training, and operations by Aloha IslandAir management. Also contributing to the accident was the insufficient oversight during a period of rapid operational expansion and corporate growth.""Board member Jim Burnett filed the following dissenting statement on the Probable Cause: ""I would add to the statement of probable cause the following additional language: Also contributing to the accident was the failure of the Federal Aviation Administration to require a Ground Proximity Warning System for Part 135 aircraft.""","The autopilot failed, causing the An-32 to enter a descending spiral. The airplane broke up in mid-air and crashed into a swamp, leaving a 7 m deep crater.The aircraft was engaged in transporting air-air missiles to a factory in Moscow for maintenance.","Impacted trees, while in a shallow, left descending turn shortly after takeoff from runway 36 at night. The Falcon hit a powerline support tower before coming to rest.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Failure of the pilot-in-command (PIC) to assure that the aircraft maintained a climb profile after takeoff. Factors related to the accident were: dark night, the crew's lack of visual perception at night, the PIC's lack of rest (fatigue), and the copilot's failure to attain remedial action.""29-06-1989","While descending to Tucson, a 115Volt AC wire of the no. 2 'B' hydraulic pump shorted and punctured a hydraulic system 'A' line. As the aircraft was approaching the airport a fire erupted and burned through to the electrical power wires to the standby hydraulic pump. After landing at Tucson, the aircraft overran the runway, collided with an abandoned concrete arresting gear structure, shearing off the nosegear and continued to slide for 3803 feet.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Failure of the operator's maintenance personnel to detect an electrical wire which had chafed against a hydraulic line and which eventually arced causing a leak in the hydraulic line and subsequent fire and hydraulic system failure. In addition, previous wear of check valves in the backup hydraulic systems prevented the airplane from stopping on the runway. A contributing factor was the airplane manufacturer's inadequate guidance for maintaining the hydraulic components.

The pilot returned to Jeddah where the hijacker was overpowered by security guards.,"Flight Air Freight 1 was a scheduled night freight flight between Palmerston North, Auckland and Christchurch. The crew consisted of a training captain and two new co-pilots who were to fly alternate legs as co-pilot and observer. The co-pilots ADI of the Convair CV-580 in question had a known intermittent defect, but had been retained in service. The aircrafts MEL however did not permit this flight to be undertaken with an unserviceable ADI. The aircraft nevertheless departed Palmerston North and arrived at Auckland at about 20:30. It was unloaded and reloaded with 11 pallets of cargo. On the next leg, to Christchurch, the handling pilot was to be the other co-pilot. Although she had completed her type rating on the Convair 580 this was her first line flight as a crew member. The flight was cleared to taxi to runway 23 for departure. Takeoff was commenced at 21:59. The aircraft climbed to a height of approx. 400 feet when it pitched down. It entered a gradual descent until it contacted the ground 387 m beyond the end of runway 23 and 91 m left of the extended centreline. The aircraft then crashed and broke up in the tidal waters of Manukau Harbour.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The probable cause of this accident was the training captains failure to monitor the aircrafts climb flightpath during the critical stage of the climb after take-off.""31-07-1989","Four Haitian nationals attempted to hijack an ALM aircraft with 37 passengers and crew on a flight between Miami and Curacao.
